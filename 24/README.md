# 24

The objective of the game is to make 24 (or 60) using all the numbers given and only the 4 basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

For example, if given the numbers 12, 7, 5, 3, you might do (7+5)*3 - 12 = 24.
Or, if you are doing 60, and with the numbers 12, 12, 5, 2, 1, you might do the combination (5-2+1)*12+12 = 60.
