# Snake

A variation on the popular arcade game "Snake." In this version, you have a limited amount of time to reach the next point/food/target. 
Further, certain food is worth more points than other types of food. 
The AI to play the game mostly uses a variation on A* search.

You can compile it yourself and watch it play by doing `make snek_AI`
